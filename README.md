# Level Generation for Super Mario Bro's using PCG

The goal of this project was to implement Procedural Content Generation to continously generate new levels for the computer game known as Super Mario Bro's.
We managed to acheive this by extracting features from existing human made levels and using it to create new ones of varying difficulty. 
A method known as chunking was followed to create our levels and is described in the report.

This was a project for the module 'Artificial Intelligence in Games'.
